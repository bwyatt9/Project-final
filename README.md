Title: League Tracker

This is a small stat tracking website for the Mobas Game League of Legends, that connects to Riot API and grabs recent match data user riot username, and shows info in a chart. I wanted a site for the game I liked playing, and because of that was able to come up with the feature I thought would be most useful, match tracking.

This project allows you to store this data in supa base as well and uses chart.js to show role wins 

It is meant for desktops but is RWD, meaning mobile-friendly
