Title: League Tracker

This is a small stat tracking website for the Mobas Game League of legends, that connects to Riot api and grabs recent match data user riot username, and shows info in a chart

This project allows you to store this data in supa base as well, and uses chart.js to show role wins (being implemented)

Meant for desktop but is RWD, meaning mobile friendly
